# History — Decision and Reference Logging

All significant decisions and citable references log to disk as JSONL.
One JSON object per line. No prose, no markdown, no commentary inside the JSON.

## Decisions

**Location:** `.logs/decisions/<topic>.jsonl`

**Format:**
```json
{"id":"<topic>-NNN","date":"YYYY-MM-DD","decision":"One-sentence statement of what was decided","rationale":"Why","alternatives":"What was considered and rejected, and why","references":["https://..."]}
```

**Rules:**
- ID prefix matches the topic filename. IDs increment sequentially. Check the last entry before writing a new one.
- One decision per line. No embedded newlines — keep the file `jq -c` parseable.
- Log the decision before or immediately after acting on it. Not "later."
- Architectural decisions require operator approval before the log entry is written.

**What counts as a decision worth logging:**
- A choice between two or more viable options.
- A constraint, assumption, or non-obvious workaround being encoded.
- A tool, framework, library, or service being adopted or rejected.
- A scope boundary being set or changed.
- Any one-way-door action.

Routine code edits, typo fixes, and pure refactors do not require log entries.

## References

**Location:** `.logs/references/<topic>.jsonl`

**Format:**
```json
{"id":"ref-NNN","date":"YYYY-MM-DD","category":"official_docs|standard|article|repo|paper","title":"...","url":"...","relevance":"why this source supports the claim"}
```

**Rules:**
- Cite every external claim. No unverifiable statistics, no "studies show…" without a link.
- Primary authorities: official vendor docs, NIST, CIS, SLSA, DORA, OWASP, official RFCs.
- Not citations: Medium posts, Stack Overflow answers, LLM outputs, screenshots without a URL.
- If a source cannot be validated, state that explicitly. Do not pretend it was validated.
