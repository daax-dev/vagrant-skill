# Workflow

## Planning
- A plan is required for any non-trivial change.
- Trivial: typo fix, single-line config update, obvious rename. Everything else requires a plan.
- Write the plan down — in the PR description, task system, or `.logs/decisions/`. Plans held only in chat do not count.
- Present trade-offs as facts: option, cost, risk, reversibility. The operator decides; the agent executes.
- Do not start coding until the plan is approved.

---

## Execution Discipline
- State assumptions that affect implementation. If the request has multiple plausible readings, ask before editing.
- Smallest change that satisfies the verified goal. No speculative features, abstractions, or config.
- Touch only what the task requires. No adjacent cleanup or drive-by refactors. Every changed line traces to the request or its validation.
- Remove only the orphans your change created; leave pre-existing dead code (mention it, don't delete).
- Define a verifiable goal before coding. Add or update tests when behavior changes (bats suites under `test/`).
- This is a general-purpose skill: keep `scripts/setup.sh` free of project-specific tooling. All scripts stay idempotent and shellcheck-clean.

---

## Work Intake
Tasks originate from (check in this order):
1. GitHub Issues — `github.com/daax-dev/vagrant-skill/issues` (active; bug reports drive fixes and PRs).
2. Direct request from operator.

Identify the source before starting. If the same task appears in multiple systems, ask which is canonical.

---

## Model Selection
- Match model capability to task complexity. Do not waste large models on small tasks.
- Code with one model; validate with a model from a **different provider where possible** (e.g., produced by Claude/Anthropic, validated by Codex/OpenAI, or vice versa). Prefer cross-provider; a different model from the same provider is the fallback; same model is last resort. Record both — producer and validator — in the PR description, and note if cross-provider was not possible.
- Call out when a task requires a paid API call. State the cost estimate before incurring it.

---

## Communication
- Report blockers immediately. No silent workarounds.
- Surface uncertainty. State confidence level. No claims of certainty without a validated primary source.
- Objective language. No first-person pronouns. No apologies.

---

## Definition of Done
A task is done only when:
- [ ] Lint and unit tests pass: `make lint && make test` (matches CI: shellcheck + `ruby -c` + bats unit suites). When a Vagrant provider is available and VM behavior changed, also run `make test-integration` (or `make test-all`).
- [ ] Skill changes validate against the Agent Skills standard: `npx --yes skills-ref validate` (CI runs this as `validate-skill`).
- [ ] PR opened with problem statement, approach, and test evidence.
- [ ] Non-trivial decisions logged in `.logs/decisions/` per `.claude/history.md`.
- [ ] Validation pass by a separate model — cross-provider (Claude ↔ Codex) where possible — recorded in the PR description as `Validation:` producer model + validator model + verdict (note if cross-provider was not possible).
- [ ] Task system of record updated to done with link to PR/commit.
